Git.

We’ll be using git throughout this project as a version control tool and to create checkpoints for every feature/functionality we finish.
First you’ll need to fork and clone the project’s repo to have a copy of the repo on your account.

•	Go to the project’s git repo
•	Click Fork on the right corner of the page

Once that’s done you’ll need to Clone it. On your terminal:

•	Use mkdir to create a folder (aka a directory) on your computer for your project. We’re gonna call it cash-dash
•	Use cd to access your project’s folder
•	Clone the project
•	Install the packages that came with the cloned repo

$ mkdir cash-dash
$ cd cash-dash
$ git clone https://github.com/<your_github_username>/Cash-dash.gi
$ yarn install

You can then run the project and view it on your browser

$ yarn start
