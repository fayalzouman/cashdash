Trello:

For this project you’ll be using Trello, which is basically like a to-do list to keep track of what you have or haven’t done yet. Open the projects Trello board which you’ll find in the Resources section. Then you’ll see four lists:

⁃	Icebox: these cards would be some additional features or future implementations to the main projects but are not currently necessary.
⁃	Backlog: these cards will have all the necessary functionalities and features that you need to do.
⁃	Doing: these cards will contain the functionalities that you’re currently working on.
⁃	Done: these cards will be all the functionalities and features that you have completed.

Right now all the cards are in the backlog list because we still haven’t started working on the project. Once we start we will be moving them to the other lists. To get started you first have to have your own copy of the board. To do that go to the Trello board for this project then:

⁃	click the “Show Menu” button on the right corner.
⁃	click “More”.
⁃	click on “Copy Board”.

Once you’ve done that you’ll have your own copy of the board on your account to start using it throughout the project.
