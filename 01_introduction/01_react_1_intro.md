INTRO

In this project you will build a website using React to create a POS (point of sale) system. POS systems are used at the cashier to check out a customerâ€™s items. The user (aka the cashier) will be able to choose from a list of products. They will also be able to view the details of the products, update the quantity and remove items from the cart.
