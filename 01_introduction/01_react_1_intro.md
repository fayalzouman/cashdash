# INTRO

In this project you will build a website using React to create a POS (point of sale) system. 

POS systems are used at the cashier to check out a customerâ€™s items. The user (aka the cashier) will be able to choose from a list of products. They will also be able to:
- View the details of the different products
- Update the quantity of the products in the cart
- Remove items from the cart
